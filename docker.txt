- To run an isolated application with different versions for software, side by side in containers.
- Easier for KT as it downloads all the binaries required by that application.

- Limitations of VM : needs full-blown OS, Slow to start, Resource intensive

- overcomes VM limitations like : running multiple apps in isolation, lightweight, use host OS, Start quickly, less hardware resources

- All containers shared the kernel of the host
- Use client-server architecture

- To make any application run on docker -> add a docker file
- The docker file includes instructions that docker uses to package this application into an image. 
- The image contains everything the application needs to run -> cut-down OS, runtime environment, application files, third-party libraries, environment variables, etc
- Once we have the image we tell docker to start the application with that image -> application gets loaded into the container/process

- We can push the image to a docker registry like docker hub, just like git and github
- After we can put in on any machine that has docker
